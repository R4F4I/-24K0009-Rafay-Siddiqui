# QUESTION#1

Explain the output of this C program. Why the wrong value is being displayed in the output?

## Answer #1

- in C, integers are stored in 16 bits which the current value is greater than, hence being an unsigned integer causes the overflow to rewritten in the identifier
- to fix this, use a long datatype to allocate more space (32 bits) to the value

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    long testInteger = 30000000000;
    printf("number is %ld", testInteger);
    return 0;
}
```

# QUESTION#2

Write a C program that takes two integer values as input from the user. Then swap the values taken from the user and display the output of the variables.

### Answer-2-pseudocode

```
input num1, num2
temp = num1
num1 = num2
num2 = temp
print(num2,num1)
```

### Answer-2-C-code

```c
//start

// adding lib
#include <stdio.h>

// start main code
int main(){
    
    // declaration
    int num1, num2, temp;

    // taking input

    // first num
    printf("enter num1:\n");
    scanf("%d",&num1);

    // second num
    printf("enter num2:\n");
    scanf("%d",&num2);
    
    // showcase initial values
    printf("first num1 is: %d \n and num2 is: %d\n", num1, num2);
    
    // swap of values
    temp = num1;
    num1 = num2;
    num2 = temp;
    // showcasing the results
    printf("now num1 is: %d \n and num2 is: %d\n", num1, num2);
    return 0;
}
//end

# QUESTION#3

A customer asks the IT firm to develop a program in C language, which can take tax rate and salary from the user on runtime and then calculate the tax, the user has to pay and the salary he/she will have after paying the tax. This information is then provided to the user.

### Answer-3-pseudocode

```
input taxRate, salary
final = taxrate*salary
salary = salary -final
print (salary)
print (final)
```

### Answer-3-C-code

```c
//start

// adding lib
#include <stdio.h>

// start main code
int main(){
    
    // declaration
    int final, taxrate, salary;

    // taking input

    // salary
    printf("enter taxrate in percentage (for example: 50 percent):\n");
    scanf("%d",&taxrate);
    while (taxrate>100){
        printf("value cannot be greater than 100!\ntry again:");
        scanf("%d",&taxrate);
    }
    taxrate = 100 - taxrate;
    // taxrate
    printf("enter salary:\n");
    scanf("%d",&salary);
    
    // now the user will enter the salary he receives after tax deduction

    final = taxrate*salary/100;
    printf("your initial salary: %d \n",salary); 
    printf("your final salary : %d \n",final);
    return 0;
}
//end
```

# QUESTION#4

A car travelled back and forth from point A to point B. With a distance being (single trip) 1207KM. During the forward trip fuel price was 118/liter while returning it was 123/liter. Calculate the total fuel cost (both ways) and the fuel consumed (total trip). Use the carâ€™s fuel average as input from the user (Input must be positive make some restrictions on only accepting positive input)
