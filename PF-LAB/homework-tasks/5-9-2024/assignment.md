# QUESTION#1

Explain the output of this C program. Why the wrong value is being displayed in the output?
![alt text](image.png)

## Answer #1

- in C, integers are stored in 16 bits which the current value is greater than, hence being an unsigned integer causes the overflow to rewritten in the identifier
- to fix this, use a long datatype to allocate more space (32 bits) to the value

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    long testInteger = 30000000000;
    printf("number is %ld", testInteger);
    return 0;
}
```

# QUESTION#2

Write a C program that takes two integer values as input from the user. Then swap the values taken from the user and display the output of the variables.

### Answer-2-pseudocode

```
input num1, num2
temp = num1
num1 = num2
num2 = temp
print(num2,num1)
```

### Answer-2-C-code

```c
//start

// adding lib
#include <stdio.h>

// start main code
int main(){
    
    // declaration
    int num1, num2, temp;

    // taking input

    // first num
    printf("enter num1:\n");
    scanf("%d",&num1);

    // second num
    printf("enter num2:\n");
    scanf("%d",&num2);
    
    // showcase initial values
    printf("first num1 is: %d \n and num2 is: %d\n", num1, num2);
    
    // swap of values
    temp = num1;
    num1 = num2;
    num2 = temp;
    // showcasing the results
    printf("now num1 is: %d \n and num2 is: %d\n", num1, num2);
    return 0;
}
//end

```

# QUESTION#3

A customer asks the IT firm to develop a program in C language, which can take tax rate and salary from the user on runtime and then calculate the tax, the user has to pay and the salary he/she will have after paying the tax. This information is then provided to the user.  

### Answer-3-flowchart

### Answer-3-pseudocode

```
input taxRate, salary
final = taxrate*salary
salary = salary -final
print (salary)
print (final)
```

### Answer-3-C-code

```c
//start

// adding lib
#include <stdio.h>

// start main code
int main(){
    
    // declaration
    int final, taxrate, salary;

    // taking input

    // salary
    printf("enter taxrate in percentage (for example: 50 percent):\n");
    scanf("%d",&taxrate);
    while (taxrate>100){
        printf("value cannot be greater than 100!\ntry again:");
        scanf("%d",&taxrate);
    }
    taxrate = 100 - taxrate;
    // taxrate
    printf("enter salary:\n");
    scanf("%d",&salary);
    
    // now the user will enter the salary he receives after tax deduction

    final = taxrate*salary/100;
    printf("your initial salary: %d \n",salary); 
    printf("your final salary : %d \n",final);
    return 0;

# QUESTION#4

A car travelled back and forth from point A to point B. With a distance being (single trip) 1207KM. During the forward trip fuel price was 118/liter while returning it was 123/liter. Calculate the total fuel cost (both ways) and the fuel consumed (total trip). Use the carâ€™s fuel average as input from the user (Input must be positive make some restrictions on only accepting positive input)

### Answer-4-flowchart

### Answer-4-pseudocode

```
dist = 1207
ffprice = 118
bfprice = 123

input fuel_avg

while feul_avg<0:
    print "enter correct val"
    input fuel_avg

ffuelconsumed = dist/ffprice
bfuelconsumed = dist/bfprice

total_fuel_consumed = ffuelconsumed + bfuelconsumed

ffuelcost = ffuelconsumed*ffprice
bfuelcost = bfuelconsumed*bfprice

total_fuel_cost = ffuelcost + bfuelcost
```

### Answer-4-C-code

```c
//start

// adding lib
#include <stdio.h>

// start main code
int main(){
    
    float fuel_consumed,total_fuel_consumed,fuel_average,frwd_fuel_cost,bckwd_fuel_cost,total_fuel_cost;
    const float dist = 1207.0;
    const float frwd_fuel_price = 118.0;
    const float bckwd_fuel_price = 123.0;
    
    printf("enter fuel average (must be greater than 0):\n");
      scanf("%f",&fuel_average);

    while (fuel_average<0){
      printf("enter valid value for fuel average:\n");
      scanf("%f",&fuel_average);
    }
    
    // fuel consumed is same as distance is same
    fuel_consumed = dist*fuel_average;
    
    // hence total fuel is twice as one back and forth trip
    total_fuel_consumed = 2*fuel_consumed;
    
    // fuel cost will be different due to different rates
    frwd_fuel_cost = fuel_consumed*frwd_fuel_price;
    bckwd_fuel_cost = fuel_consumed*bckwd_fuel_price;
    
    // total fuel cost
    total_fuel_cost = frwd_fuel_cost + bckwd_fuel_cost;
    
    printf("total fuel cost %f \n",total_fuel_cost);
    printf("total fuel consumed %f \n",total_fuel_consumed);
}
//end
