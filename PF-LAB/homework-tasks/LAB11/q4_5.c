? |Titanic Survival Analysis (Using Titanic CSV Dataset)
? |     * Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle (CSV format). The dataset contains information about
? |     passengers, such as:
? |         o PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked.
? |     * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset?resource=download
? |
? |You are tasked with creating a C program to perform the following:
? |
? |     2. Load the Titanic dataset into a Data structure (e.g., a structure for passengers).
? |     3. Calculate the average age of all passengers.
? |     4. Find the survival rate based on sex (male vs female).
? |     
? |     5. Display the list of passengers who survived, along with their names, ages, and class.
? |     6. Display the list of passengers with missing cabin details.
? |
? |File Handling:
? |     * Input: Titanic data will be loaded from a CSV file.
? |     * Output: Write the results of the queries into a new CSV file or display them on the screen.
? |Steps:
? |     * Define a Passenger structure with appropriate fields to match the columns of the Titanic dataset.
? |     * Parse the CSV file using fopen() and fscanf() (or use string handling to manually parse rows).
? |     * Write functions to calculate statistics (average age, survival rate, etc.).
? |     * Store results or display them using the printf() function.
