# Problem 1: Miles per hour to kilometers per seconds

This year olympics were held in Europe causing all sorts of problems for the Americans as they donâ€™t use the standard measures like meters and kilometers, grams and kilograms. For racing events the speeds are measured in kilometers per seconds. Can you design a solution to convert kilometers per seconds to miles per hour for US viewers of the Paris Olympics?

### Input

- speed in kilometers per second or kmps or 3600 kmph

### process

- convert speed in kmph to speed in miles per hour or mph

### output

- speed in mph

## Pseudocode

- 1 km = 0.62miles
- 1 km/h = 0.62mi/h
- x km/h = 0.62x mi/h

Hence, for x kmph, mph is 3600\*0.62\*x

```pseudocode
input speed_1

speed_2 = speed_1*0.62*3600

output speed_2

```
