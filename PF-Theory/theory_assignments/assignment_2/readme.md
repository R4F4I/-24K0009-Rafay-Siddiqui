## Typical problems faced during this assignment

### ceveats of `C`
- Most problematic was dealing with ceveats of `C` , dealing with string functions was the most frustating
### Dealing with the finetuning, 
- there were moments where basic logic building failed and I had to resort slight changes in inputs and loops to acheive the desired results
### Overly complex methods
- At times, the intial logic proposed required too many mechansims to acheive the desired results, these ideas were abandoned when they were met with above two problems
- One example of a method being follwed is in finding the second smallest, this could have been solved with just sorting the array and choosing the value at 2 index
