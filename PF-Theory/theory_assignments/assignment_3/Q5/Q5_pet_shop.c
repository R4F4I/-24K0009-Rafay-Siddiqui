? | You're building an inventory system for a pet shop called "Pets in Heart" that keeps track of
? | different species of animals and their specific supplies (e.g., food, toys, bedding). The shop
? | inventory system uses a 2D dynamic array char** speciesSupplies where:
? |     ● Rows are explicitly set for each species (e.g., "Dogs," "Cats," "Parrots"), and each row
? |       corresponds to a different species.
? |     ● Columns are dynamically allocated for each species to hold their specific supplies (e.g.,
? |       "Food," "Leash," "Toys").
? | 
? | Task:
? | 
? | Write a C program that:
? | 
? |     1. Initialize the Inventory: Allocate memory for a specified number of species, with each
? |        species having its own list of supplies (initially empty).
? |     2. Add Supplies: For each species, dynamically allocate memory for a list of supplies and allow
? |        the user to add supplies for that species.
? |     3. Update Supplies: Let users update the name of a supply item for a specific species.
? |     4. Remove Species: Allow users to delete a species and free the associated memory (both for
? |        the species and its supplies).
? |     5. Display Inventory: Show the current supplies for each species in the inventory.
