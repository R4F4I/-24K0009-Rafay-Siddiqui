## Typical problems faced during this assignment

### caveats of `C`
The most problematic was dealing with caveats of `C`, such as dealing with string functions
### Dealing with the fine-tuning, 
- there were moments where basic logic building failed and I had to resort to slight changes in inputs and loops to achieve the desired results
### Overly complex methods
- At times, the initial logic proposed required too many mechanisms to acheive the desired results, these ideas were abandoned when they were met with above two problems
- One example of a method being followed is in finding the second smallest, this could have been solved by just sorting the array and choosing the value at 2 index
